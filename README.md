Material for GWC WashU Facilitator training and support material for student groups. If you have any questions, please reach out to either of the Curriculum Chairs, Arushee Agrawal and Jessica Thoelke either directly, or via the official email address (curriculum[dot]gwcwashu[at]gmail[dot]com). A few notes:

- The ReadMe.md files inside each directory have information on the specified topic, including examples. 
- At the end of each ReadMe, there are links to additional resources, and to exercises. Each link to an exercise will lead to a page that you should try to replicate. The solutions to these exercises will be inside the exercises-solutions directory.
