- HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language. This means, HTML is used to define our web page's markup, or in simpler terms, to define content formatting. 
- It's primary purpose is to define and label all the content on a web page. HTML can tell us what the title of a page should be, what our headings and subheadings are, what sections and links our page contains. 
- It is important to note that HTML is **not** meant to alter the way our page looks, i.e. it is not used for design purposes. For design, we will be using CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, which will be introduced in the next module.
